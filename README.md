# Cross Methylome Omnibus (CMO) test

CMO is a gene-level association test and can identify many significant and novel genes that have been ignored by competing methods. Specifically,  CMO integrates genetically regulated DNAm in enhancers, promoters, and the gene body to identify additional disease-associated genes.

In this repo, we provide the following sources.

* CMO: the software for running CMO test (under development)
* Codes: all sources codes for replicating the results present in the manuscript.
